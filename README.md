# Computer Vision Final Project: Street Fighter Feature Matching

## Goal of Project
Applying the concepts of image transformation and feature matching that we learned in CS 482 and applying to using it so a program takes an input of a Street Fighter character image, and is able to correctly identify which character it is, and what move it is.
